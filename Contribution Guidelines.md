Contribution Guidelines:

Welcome to Django Boards! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to our open-source project. Here are a few simple guidelines to help you get started:

1. **Familiarize Yourself**: Take some time to explore the project's codebase, documentation, and existing issues. Understanding the project's goals and structure will be beneficial as you contribute.

2. **Create an Issue**: If you spot a bug, have an idea for a new feature, or want to suggest improvements, start by creating an issue. Provide a clear and concise description of the problem or enhancement you have in mind.

3. **Claim an Issue**: Check the list of open issues and see if there's one that you'd like to work on. If so, comment on the issue to let others know that you're taking it.

4. **Branching**: Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes.

5. **Code and Test**: Write your code following the project's coding style and guidelines. Remember to include unit tests to ensure the reliability of your changes.

6. **Pull Request**: Once you're ready, submit a pull request (PR) with a clear title and description. Provide a summary of your changes and reference the related issue, if applicable.

7. **Code Review**: Be patient during the code review process. Reviewers may provide feedback and suggest improvements to ensure the quality of the code.

8. **Merge**: After your PR has been approved and any requested changes are addressed, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main branch.

9. **Celebrate**: Congratulations! Your contribution is now part of `Django Boards`. Thank you for helping make this project better.

We encourage you to join our community and engage with other contributors. Feel free to ask questions, share ideas, and help others as you become more familiar with the project.

Happy contributing!
